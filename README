== About Snippy

Snippy is an open source clone of Josh Goebel's Pastie.

A lot of Pastie users (including me) wanted a private version. Snippy fills that void - enjoy.

=== Author

It was written by Flinn Mueller using Ruby on Rails 2.1 as a weekend project. I felt like one of the best features of Pastie is code highlighting so I made it a priority. Code highlighting is accomplished using a custom renderer with Ultraviolet. The Thinking Sphinx plugin has been on my radar for a little while now so I felt like it was a good time to throw that in.

=== On Github

Git has also been on my radar for a little while. So I figured I would host the project at Github - everyone wins. Get the source on Github.
